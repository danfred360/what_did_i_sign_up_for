# What did I sign up for?

The purpose of this project is to provide a tool for understanding what you signed up for. You add files (ex. terms of service, privacy policy) and generate embeddings of segments of the documents in the file. These embeddings can be used for semantic search and to provide context for prompts to an llm for question answering. The segments included in the field of search can be filtered by file, collection, or file class. 

*See [the docs](./docs/index.md).*
